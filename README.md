# Navigator

- Easy code navigation through LSP and üå≤üè°Treesitter symbols; view diagnostic errors.

- Put language server and tree sitter's parser together. Not only for better highlight but also display symbol context
and scope.

Here is an example

Show javascript call tree üå≤ of a variable inside a closure. Similar to incoming&outgoing calls from LSP. This feature
is designed for the symbol analysis.

Explains:
- There are 3 references for the symbol <span style="color:red"> *browser* </span> in closure.js
- The first reference of browser is an assigement, an emoji of üìù indicates the value changed in this line. In many
cases, we search for reference to find out where the value changed.
- The second reference of `browser` is inside function `displayName` and `displayName` sit inside `makeFunc`, So you
will see ` displayName{} <-  makeFunc{}`
- The third similar to the second, as var browser is on the right side of '=', the value not changed in this line
and emoji is not shown.

Struct type references in multiple Go Ô≥ë files

This feature can provide you info in which function/class/method the variable was referenced. It is handy for large
project where class/function defination is too long to fit into preview window. Also provides a birdview of where the
variable is referenced.

# Features:

- LSP easy setup. Support the most commonly used lsp clients setup. Dynamic lsp activation based on buffer type. This
also enable you handle workspace combine mix types of codes (e.g. Go + javascript + yml)

- Out of box experience. 10 lines of minimum vimrc can turn your neovim into a full-featured LSP & Treesitter powered IDE

- Unorthodox UI with floating windows, navigator provides a visual way to manage and navigate through symbols, diagnostic errors, reference etc. Is covers
all features(handler) provided by LSP from commenly used search reference, to less commenly used search for interface
implementation.

- Async request with lsp.buf_request for reference search

- Treesitter symbol search. It is handy for large filas (Some of LSP e.g. sumneko_lua, there is a 100kb file size limition?)

- FZY search with Lua-JIT

- Better navigation for diagnostic errors, Navigate through all files/buffers that contain errors/warnings

- Grouping references/implementation/incoming/outgoing based on file names.

- Treesitter based variable/function context analysis. It is 10x times faster compared to purely rely on LSP. In most
of the case, it takes treesitter less than 4 ms to read and render all nodes for a file of 1,000 LOC.

- The first plugin, IMO, that allows you to search in all treesitter symbols in the workspace.

- Nerdfont, emoji for LSP and Treesitter kind

- Optimize display (remove trailing bracket/space), display the caller of reference, de-duplicate lsp results (e.g reference
in the same line). Using treesitter for file preview highlighter etc

# Why a new plugin

I'd like to go beyond what the system is providing.

# Install

Require nvim-0.5.0 (a.k.a nightly)

You can remove your lspconfig setup and use this plugin.
The plugin depends on lspconfig and [guihua.lua](https://github.com/ray-x/guihua.lua), which provides GUI and fzy support(migrate from [romgrk's project](romgrk/fzy-lua-native)).

```vim
Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
Plug 'ray-x/guihua.lua', {'do': 'cd lua/fzy && make' }
Plug 'ray-x/navigator.lua'
```

Note: Highly recommened: 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'

Packer

```lua

use {'ray-x/navigator.lua', requires = {'ray-x/guihua.lua', run = 'cd lua/fzy && make'}}

```

## Setup

Easy setup **BOTH** lspconfig and navigator with one liner. Navigator covers arounds 20 most used LSP setup.

```lua
lua require'navigator'.setup()
```

## Sample vimrc turning your neovim into a full-featured IDE

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
Plug 'ray-x/guihua.lua', {'do': 'cd lua/fzy && make' }
Plug 'ray-x/navigator.lua'

" Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-compe' and other plugins you commenly use...

" optional, if you need treesitter symbol support
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate'}

call plug#end()

" No need for rquire('lspconfig'), navigator will configure it for you
lua <<EOF
require'navigator'.setup()
EOF


```

You can remove your lspconfig.lua and use the hooks of navigator.lua. As the
navigator will bind keys and handler for you. The LSP will be loaded lazily based on filetype.

Nondefault configuration example:

```lua

require.'navigator'.setup({
  debug = false, -- log output not implemented
  code_action_icon = "Ô†¥ ",
  width = 0.75, -- number of cols for the floating window
  height = 0.3, -- preview window size, 0.3 by default
  on_attach = nil,
  -- put a on_attach of your own here, e.g
  -- function(client, bufnr)
  --   -- the on_attach will be called at end of navigator on_attach
  -- end,

  treesitter_call_tree = true, -- treesitter variable context
  sumneko_root_path = vim.fn.expand("$HOME") .. "/github/sumneko/lua-language-server",
  sumneko_binary = vim.fn.expand("$HOME") ..
      "/github/sumneko/lua-language-server/bin/macOS/lua-language-server",
  code_action_prompt = {enable = true, sign = true, sign_priority = 40, virtual_text = true},
  lsp = {
    format_on_save = true, -- set to false to disasble lsp code format on save (if you are using prettier/efm/formater etc)
    tsserver = {
      filetypes = {'typescript'} -- disable javascript etc,
      -- set to {} to disable the lspclient for all filetype
    },
    gopls = {   -- gopls setting
      settings = {
        gopls = {gofumpt = false} -- disable gofumpt etc,
      }
    }
  }
})


```


## Dependency

- lspconfig
- guihua.lua (provides floating window, FZY)
- Optional:
  - treesitter (list treesitter symbols, object analysis)
  - lsp-signature (better signature help)

The plugin can be loaded lazily (packer `opt = true` ), And it will check if optional plugins existance and load those plugins only if they existed.

The termianl will need to be able to output nerdfont and emoji correctly. I am using Kitty with nerdfont (Victor Mono).

## Usage

Please refer to lua/navigator/lspclient/mapping.lua on key mappings. Should be able to work out-of-box.

- Use \<c-e\> or `:q!` to kill the floating window
- <up/down> (or \<c-n\>, \<c-p\>) to move
- \<c-o\> or \<CR\> to open location or apply code actions. Note: \<CR\> might be binded in insert mode by other plugins

## Configuration

In `navigator.lua` there is a default configration. You can override the values by pass you own values

e.g

```lua
-- The attach will be call at end of navigator on_attach()
require'navigator'.setup({on_attach = function(client, bufnr) require 'illuminate'.on_attach(client)})
```

# Break changes and known issues
[known issues I am working on](https://github.com/ray-x/navigator.lua/issues/1)

# Todo

- Early phase, bugs expected, PR and suggestions are welcome
- Async (some of the requests is slow on large codebases and might be good to use co-rountine)
- More clients. I use go, python, js/ts, java, c/cpp, lua most of the time. Did not test other languages (e.g dart, swift etc)
- Configuration options
